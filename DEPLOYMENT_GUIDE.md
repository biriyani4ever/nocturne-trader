# Deployment Guide for Zylo Trading Dashboard

## Project Structure for Handoff

This is a complete, production-ready React trading dashboard application that requires backend API integration to replace mock data.

## Quick Start

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your Supabase credentials
   ```

3. **Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Production Build**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Key Files for Backend Integration

- `BACKEND_REQUIREMENTS.md` - Complete API specification
- `src/lib/market-events.ts` - Mock market data structures
- `src/pages/*.tsx` - Components that need API integration
- `src/hooks/useAuth.tsx` - Authentication (already integrated with Supabase)

## What's Already Complete

✅ **Frontend Features**:
- Complete responsive UI with dark/light themes
- User authentication (Supabase)
- Portfolio management interface
- Market analysis dashboard
- Trading alerts system
- Settings and preferences
- PDF export functionality
- Multi-currency and timezone support

✅ **Technical Implementation**:
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- React Router for navigation
- Form validation with react-hook-form
- State management with React Context
- Error handling and loading states

## What Needs Backend Integration

❌ **Replace Mock Data With Real APIs**:
- Market indices and sector data
- Portfolio holdings and performance
- Trading alerts and notifications
- IPO and dividend information
- Market analysis and trends

## Deployment Options

### Frontend Deployment
- **Vercel** (Recommended): Connect GitHub repo for auto-deploy
- **Netlify**: Drag/drop `dist` folder after `npm run build`
- **AWS S3 + CloudFront**: Upload build files to S3 bucket

### Backend Requirements
- RESTful API server (Node.js, Python, Java, etc.)
- Real-time market data integration
- Database for user portfolios and alerts
- WebSocket support for live updates (optional)

## Security Notes

- Supabase handles user authentication securely
- API keys are environment-based (not hardcoded)
- All routes are protected with authentication checks
- CORS configuration needed for API endpoints

## Development Workflow

1. Backend developer implements APIs per `BACKEND_REQUIREMENTS.md`
2. Replace mock data imports with API calls
3. Test integration with development API endpoints
4. Deploy frontend and backend to production

## Support

The codebase is well-documented with TypeScript interfaces and component structures that clearly show data requirements. All mock data follows the exact structure needed by the frontend components.
